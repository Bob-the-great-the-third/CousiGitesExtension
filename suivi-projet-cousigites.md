Bug:
    Dans page d'accueil 2nd refresh (cannot read "duration" of null) (unsure still exists (can't find it))

Ensure added locations are shown directly,
Ensure, when cache is loaded, that new locations are calculated anew

Bottom and top css panels still look like shit (lot of technical debt with this)

# Cousigites

Cousigites is a Chrome extension that uses the Google Maps API to quickly show driving distances from multiple origin points to a given vacation rental on selected websites.

The project was created to help plan large family holidays by displaying, directly on the page, how far each participant is from the rental. This makes it easier to choose a location by avoiding the need to look up each distance individually on a map.

Here's the extension panel (circled in red) on the "GrandsGites" website.
